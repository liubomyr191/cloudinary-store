Django Cloudinary Storage
=========================

Django Cloudinary Storage is a Django package that facilitates integration with [Cloudinary](http://cloudinary.com/)
by implementing [Django Storage API](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.10/howto/custom-file-storage/).
With several lines of configuration, you can start using Cloudinary for both media and static files.
Also, it provides management commands for removing unnecessary files, so any cleanup will be a breeze.
It uses [pycloudinary](https://github.com/cloudinary/pycloudinary) package under the hood.

Requirements
------------

The package requires Python 2.7 or 3.4+ and Django 1.8+. It has been tested on Linux, Windows and Mac OS X.

Installation
------------

To install the package, just run:
```
$ pip install django-cloudinary-storage
```

If you need to upload any video files, run:
```
$ pip install django-cloudinary-storage[video]
```
which will additionally install [python-magic](https://github.com/ahupp/python-magic) for uploaded video validation.

Also, in case you use Django `ImageField`, make sure you have Pillow installed:
```
$ pip install Pillow
```

Once you have done that, add `cloudinary` and `cloudinary_storage` to you installed apps in your `settings.py`:
```python
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    # ...
    'cloudinary_storage',
    'django.contrib.staticfiles',
    'cloudinary',
    # ...
]
```
Make sure that `cloudinary_storage` is before `django.contrib.staticfiles`, otherwise the package won't work properly.

Next, you need to add Cloudinary credentials to `settings.py`:
```python
CLOUDINARY_STORAGE = {
    'CLOUD_NAME': 'your_cloud_name',
    'API_KEY': 'your_api_key',
    'API_SECRET': 'your_api_secret'
}
```

Usage with media files
----------------------

The package provides three media storages:
- `cloudinary_storage.storage.MediaCloudinaryStorage` for images
- `cloudinary_storage.storage.RawMediaCloudinaryStorage` for raw files, like txt, pdf
- `cloudinary_storage.storage.VideoMediaCloudinaryStorage` for videos

Above distinction if necessary as Cloudinary API needs to know resource type in many of its methods.

Now, let's consider the most probable scenario that you will use Cloudinary for images uploaded by users of your website.
Let's say you created a following Django model:
```python
class TestModel(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    image = models.ImageField(upload_to='images/', blank=True)
```
All you need to do is to add two lines to `settings.py`:
```python
MEDIA_URL = '/media/'  # or any prefix you choose
DEFAULT_FILE_STORAGE = 'cloudinary_storage.storage.MediaCloudinaryStorage'
```
And that's it! All your models with `ImageField` will be connected to Cloudinary.

Now, in order to put this image into your template, you can just type:
```django
<img src="{{ test_model_instance.image.url }}" alt="{{ test_model_instance.image.name }}">
```

However, doing that in this way, the image will be downloaded with its original size, as uploaded by a user. To have more
control, you can use Cloudinary image transformations. For example, to change the image's size, use below code:
```django
{% load cloudinary %}
{% cloudinary test_model_instance.image.name width=100 height=100 %}
```
Of cource, this only scratched the surface. Cloudinary is extremely powerful and I highly recommend you to check
[pycloudinary](https://github.com/cloudinary/pycloudinary) documentation.

Now, if you only need to use Cloudinary for images, you can skip the rest of this subsection.
However, if you are going to use it for videos and/or raw files, let's continue.

### Usage with raw files

If your users can upload text or other raw files, but not images, you would just use different default storage
in `settings.py`:
```python
DEFAULT_FILE_STORAGE = 'cloudinary_storage.storage.RawMediaCloudinaryStorage'
```
But what if they could upload both types? Well, not a problem! Just set `DEFAULT_FILE_STORAGE` setting to the most common
resource type, and for fields of different type, you will need to set a correct storage individually, like this:
```python
from django.db import models

from cloudinary_storage.storage import RawMediaCloudinaryStorage

class TestModelWithRawFileAndImage(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    raw_file = models.ImageField(upload_to='raw/', blank=True, storage=RawMediaCloudinaryStorage())
    image = models.ImageField(upload_to='images/', blank=True)  # no need to set storage, field will use the default one
```
In above example we assumed `DEFAULT_FILE_STORAGE = 'cloudinary_storage.storage.MediaCloudinaryStorage'`, that's why we set
storage explicitly only for `raw_file`.

### Usage with video files

Usage with video files is analogous to raw files, but you will need to use `validate_video` validator for video fields
to validate user's uploaded videos. If not, Cloudinary will raise an error if a user tries to upload non-video file,
which will crash your website. Of cource, you could use your own validator, but if you want to use built-in one,
do it like this:
```python
from django.db import models

from cloudinary_storage.storage import VideoMediaCloudinaryStorage
from cloudinary_storage.validators import validate_video

class TestModelWithVideoAndImage(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    video = models.ImageField(upload_to='videos/', blank=True, storage=VideoMediaCloudinaryStorage(),
                              validators=[validate_video])
    image = models.ImageField(upload_to='images/', blank=True)  # no need to set storage, field will use the default one
```

Usage with static files
-----------------------

In order to move your static files to Cloudinary, update your `settings.py`:
```python
STATIC_URL = '/static/'
STATICFILES_STORAGE = 'cloudinary_storage.storage.StaticHashedCloudinaryStorage'
```

After that, run Django `collectstatic` command:
```
$ python manage.py collectstatic
```

Please note that only files with hashed name will be uploaded by default - this behavior can be changed by adding
`--upload-unhashed-files` argument to `collectstatic` command. If you are not sure why it is useful to add hash to file
names, shortly speaking, it allowes static files to be safely cached by Cloudinary CDN and web browsers. Without it
files' modification would become very problematic, because your website's users would use their private older copies.
Hashing prevents this issue as any file change will change its url as well, which would force a browser to download
a new version of a file.

Also, be aware that `collectstatic` will create a JSON file, which shows mapping of unhashed file names to their hashed
versions. This file will be available at `./manifest/staticfiles.json` by default - you could change that
in your `settings.py`, for example:
```python
import os

BASE_DIR = os.path.dirname(os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__)))

CLOUDINARY_STORAGE = {
    # other settings, like credentials
    'STATICFILES_MANIFEST_ROOT': os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'my-manifest-directory')
}
```
It is highly recommended to keep up-to-date version of this file in your version control system.

In order to use static files from Cloudinary, make sure you write your templates in below style:
```django
{% load static from staticfiles %}
<link rel="stylesheet" href="{% static 'css/style.css' %}">
```
In Django 1.10 and later, you could use `{% load static %}` instead of `{% load static from staticfiles %}`.

Please note that you must set `DEBUG` to `False` to fetch static files from Cloudinary. With `DEBUG` equal to `True`,
Django `staticfiles` app will use your local files for easier and faster development.

Management commands
-------------------

The package provides three management commands:
- `collectstatic`
- `deleteorphanedmedia`
- `deleteredundantstatic`

### collectstatic

Adds minor modifications to Django `collectstatic` to improve upload performance. It uploads only hashed files as the default. Also, it uploads a file only when necessary, namely it won't upload the file if a file with the same name and content will be already uploaded to Cloudinary, which will save both time and bandwidth.

Optional arguments:
- `--upload-unhashed-files` - uploads files without hash added to their name along with hashed ones, use it only when it is
really necessary
- `--noinput` - non-interactive mode, the command won't ask you to do any confirmations

### deleteorphanedmedia

Deletes needless media files, which are not connected to any model. It is possible to provide paths to prevent deletion
of given files in `EXCLUDE_DELETE_ORPHANED_MEDIA_PATHS` in `settings.py`, for example:
```python
CLOUDINARY_STORAGE = {
    # other settings
    'EXCLUDE_DELETE_ORPHANED_MEDIA_PATHS': ('path/', 'second-path/')
}
```

Optional arguments:
- `--noinput` - non-interactive mode, the command won't ask you to do any confirmations

### deleteredundantstatic

Deletes needless static files.

Optional arguments:
- `--keep-unhashed-files` - use it if you use `collectstatic` with `--upload-unhashed-files` argument,
without it this command will always delete all unhashed files
- `--noinput` - non-interactive mode, the command won't ask you to do any confirmations

Settings
--------

Below you can see all available settings with default values:
```python
import os

BASE_DIR = os.path.dirname(os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__)))

CLOUDINARY_STORAGE = {
    'CLOUD_NAME': None,  # required
    'API_KEY': None,  # required
    'API_SECRET': None,  # required
    'SECURE': True,
    'MEDIA_TAG': 'media',
    'INVALID_VIDEO_ERROR_MESSAGE': 'Please upload a valid video file.',
    'EXCLUDE_DELETE_ORPHANED_MEDIA_PATHS': (),
    'STATIC_TAG': 'static',
    'STATICFILES_MANIFEST_ROOT': os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'manifest'),
    'MAGIC_FILE_PATH': 'magic'
}
```
`CLOUD_NAME`, `API_KEY` and `API_SECRET` are mandatory and you need to define them in `CLOUDINARY_STORAGE` dictionary
in `settings.py`, the rest could be overwritten if required, as described below:
- `SECURE` - whether your Cloudinary files should be server over HTTP or HTTPS, HTTPS is the default, set it to False
to switch to HTTP
- `MEDIA_TAG` - name assigned to your all media files, it has to be different than `STATIC_TAG`, usually you don't
need to worry about this setting, it is useful when you have several websites which use the same Cloudinary acount, when
you should set it unique to distinguish it from other websites,
- `INVALID_VIDEO_ERROR_MESSAGE` - error message which will be desplayed in user's form when one tries to upload non-video
file in video field
- `EXCLUDE_DELETE_ORPHANED_MEDIA_PATHS` - looked by `deleteorphanedmedia` command, you can provide here tuple of paths
which will never be deleted
- `STATIC_TAG` - name assigned to your all static files, it has to be different than `MEDIA_TAG`, please see `MEDIA_TAG`
setting to see when it is useful
- `STATICFILES_MANIFEST_ROOT` - path where `staticfiles.json` will be saved after `collectstatic` command, `./manifest`
is the default location
- `MAGIC_FILE_PATH`: applicable only for Windows, needed for python-magic library for movie validation, please see
[python-magic](https://github.com/ahupp/python-magic#dependencies) for reference

How to run tests
----------------

First, install tox:
```
$ pip install tox
```

Then, just run:
```
$ tox
```
which will execute tests for Python 2.7, 3.4 - 3,5 and Django 1.8 - 1.10. At the end you will see coverage report
in your console. HTML version of this report will be available in `./htmlcov/index.html` file.

If you only need to run tests for your environment, add `-e` argument to `tox` command in `{py27,py34,py35}-dj{18,19,110}`
format, for example:
```
$ tox -e py34-dj110
```
which will run tests for Python 3.4 and Django 1.10.
